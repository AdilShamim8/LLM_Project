# End to End Gen AI Project Using Langchain and OpenAI in the Finance Domain  

## Project Overview  

This project is an end-to-end Generative AI application built using Langchain and OpenAI's models, tailored specifically for the finance domain. It aims to streamline financial analysis, reporting, and decision-making processes by harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs).   

## Features  

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Analyze and interpret financial texts, reports, and news articles.  
- **Data Extraction:** Automatically extract key financial metrics and insights from unstructured data.  
- **Report Generation:** Generate insightful financial reports in natural language based on input data.  
- **Q&A System:** Provide instant answers to financial queries using natural language.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Assess the sentiment of financial news and reports to gauge market trends.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Langchain:** A framework for developing applications powered by LLMs, allowing for seamless integration of various LLM capabilities.  
- **OpenAI:** Utilized for accessing advanced language models for text generation and understanding.  
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations on financial data.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.
